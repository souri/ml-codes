Predicting a biological response of molecules from their chemical properties

The objective of this is to help us build as good a model as possible so that we can, as optimally as this data allows, relate molecular information, to an actual biological response.

Each row in the data set represents a molecule. The first column contains experimental data describing an actual biological response; the molecule was seen to elicit this response (1), or not (0). The remaining columns represent molecular descriptors (d1 through d1776), these are calculated properties that can capture some of the characteristics of the molecule - for example size, shape, or elemental constitution. The descriptor matrix has been normalized.
